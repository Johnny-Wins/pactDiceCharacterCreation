            <ul>
                <li>
                    You assemble a pool of six sided dice, roll them, and count how many of them have a result of "5" or "6." That is your number of successes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Your basic dice pool is two plus the stat that best fits the task at hand.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you have an applicable basic or mastery skill (which in the basic rules says it gives you an extra die and lets you keep the best result), here you simply add one die to your pool.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you have a background which could apply to the situation at hand, and you have the time and focus to apply it to the task, you can add one extra die per applicable background.
                </li>

                <li>
                    (Some backgrounds or skills may give you different advantages other than extra dice, but in general anything which the base rules say gives you an extra die or a +1 to your result will give you an extra die in the new system)
                </li>
                    
                <li>
                    Most tasks you will come across require two successes. A task which requires one is unusually simple, a task which requires three is exceptionally difficult.
                </li>

                <li>
                    See the below chart for your chances of different successes given different numbers of dice; Each percentage listed is the chance of getting *at least* n successes, hence why they often sum to above 100%:
                </li>

            <h2>Misc Other Changes</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>We can't spend clues to improve our rolls for making new practices, which is intended to make all the cards in our spellcasting groups other than the strongest one more important.</li>
                <li>There's no way to improve spells we already have other than to simply research them again and hope to get a better result (this one is actually in the base rules and we may have just been playing wrong last time).</li>
                <li>The system for researching spells uses the old rules, unchanged from their previous state (so a 1d6 based system), with the exception that the learning skill now allows you to roll an extra 1d6 per research roll and replace one of your PALE dice with it.</li>
                <li>Karma no longer provides passive buffs and debuffs. Instead, you may pay 1 white karma to double your dice pool on any roll, and the GM may use one black karma to halve your dice pool on any roll (rounded down).</li>
                <li>You may not spend yourself into karmic debt without the use of practices</li>
                <li>You may cancel out black and white karma by taking an action to do so if you have 1 black karma and 1 white karma. If the GM is invoking your black karma, it is too late to do this.</li>
                <li>You may make intelligence rolls to see if your character is smart enough to not say something you've just said.</li>
            </ul>

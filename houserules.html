                Dice Mechanic
            </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You assemble a pool of six sided dice, roll them, and count how many of them have a result of "5" or "6." That is your number of successes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Your basic dice pool is two plus the stat that best fits the task at hand.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you have an applicable basic or mastery skill (which in the basic rules says it gives you an extra die and lets you keep the best result), here you simply add one die to your pool.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you have a background which could apply to the situation at hand, and you have the time and focus to apply it to the task, you can add one extra die per applicable background.
                </li>

                <li>
                    (Some backgrounds or skills may give you different advantages other than extra dice, but in general anything which the base rules say gives you an extra die or a +1 to your result will give you an extra die in the new system)
                </li>
                    
                <li>
                    Most tasks you will come across require two successes. A task which requires one is unusually simple, a task which requires three is exceptionally difficult.
                </li>

                <li>
                    See the below chart for your chances of different successes given different numbers of dice; Each percentage listed is the chance of getting *at least* n successes, hence why they often sum to above 100%:
                </li>

            <h2>Misc Other Changes</h2>

            <h3>Character Advancement</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>The system for skill training now requires a cumulative five successes to learn a skill, rather than a cumulative total of 12. Also (and this change is from the base rules): We no longer add knowledge to all skill training rolls. </li>
                    <li>The system for researching spells uses the old rules, largely unchanged from their previous state (so a 1d6 based system), with the exception that the learning skill now allows you to roll an extra 1d6 per research roll and replace one of your PALE dice with it.</li>
                    <li>We can't spend clues to improve our rolls for making new practices, which is intended to make all the cards in our spellcasting groups other than the strongest one more important.</li>
                    <li>There's no way to improve spells we already have other than to simply research them again and hope to get a better result (this one is actually in the base rules and we may have just been playing wrong last time).</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Systems of Karma</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Karma no longer provides passive buffs and debuffs. Instead, you may pay 1 white karma to double your dice pool on any roll, and the GM may use one black karma to halve your dice pool on any roll (rounded down).</li>
                    <li>You may not spend white karma for beneficial effects unless you have white karma (which is to say, you can't intentionally go into debt to get something you want).</li>
                    <li>You may cancel out black and white karma by taking an action to do so if you have 1 black karma and 1 white karma. If the GM is invoking your black karma, it is too late to do this.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Other</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>You may make intelligence rolls (knowledge or social, whichever's more appropriate) to see if your character is smart enough to not say something you've just said as their player.</li>
                    <li>When investigating or starting to pursue a practice, roll knowledge and add your arcana bonuses:</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li> At one success you have a vague idea of what you shouldn't do because it's dangerous or ill advised.</li>
                        <li> At two you have a concrete idea of how to start doing the practice. </li>
                        <li> At three you have some idea of how to do some things within the practice that go beyond the bare basics.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>

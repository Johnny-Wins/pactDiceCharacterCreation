        <p>You will be selecting cards from pre-arranged tables in order to build a character with them.</p>

        <p>Some cards have better quality than others, and you will compete with other players to get the best ones.</p>

        <p>There are multiple categories, so it's possible for everyone to be the best at different things- or for one person to end up with all the best cards, and everyone else to end up with very weak characters.</p>

        <h2>The Draft, Step-by-Step</h2>

        <ol>
          <li> Cards are laid out to form the six tables; each table contains 3 Supremes (12%), 5 Goods (20%), 5 Moderates (20%) 5 Poors (20%), 5 Awfuls (20%), and 2 (8%) Worsts, shuffled into random positions. The middle card of every table is always a Moderate.</li>
          <li>All players simultaneously and secretly select a row or column that they want from one table of their choice.</li>

          <div class="center">
            <img src="GridExample.PNG">
          </div>

          <li>If everyone selected different rows/columns from each table, they each get the cards they picked. If there are cards that multiple players selected, those players <b>Clash.</b></li>
          <li>All cards that got taken are replaced with face-down cards from the "Unknown" deck. The Unknown deck has a distribution of 1 Supreme (5%), 2 Goods (10%), 3 Moderates (15%), 4 Poors (20%), 5 Awfuls (25%), and 5 Worsts (25%). The average quality of an unknown card is 1.8; better than a Worst, but not as good as an Awful.</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 until each player has five cards from each table.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="inner">
        <h2>Clashes</h2>

        <p>First, players get a chance to make a deal. In a deal you may propose any possible split of cards (for example P1 taking a supreme card, and P2 taking the remaining four).</p>

        <p>Players draw Unknown cards equal to the number they gave to their opponent, so they will always end up taking five no matter what.</p>

        <p>Deals may also include promises about what kind of character you'll play, or what relationships they'll have to other characters.</p>

        <p>If the players can't or won't agree to a deal, they go to a Dilemma, which resembles the Prisoner's Dilemma, with players having the chance to get white marks (perks and advantages) or black marks (flaws and detrimental traits).</p>

        <p>Black Dots are simply personal circumstances or traits which disadvantage your character, and White Dots are circumstances or traits which advantage them. There's no specific system for determining them, they're worked out between players and the GM. They bare no relationship to the black and white karma that is used during play.</p>

        <h2>Rules Changes</h2>
        
        <div>
          <p>If you've played Pact Dice before, you may be familiar with a system based around singular d6 rolls, with many bonuses giving you the choice of rolling another dice and taking the best of all your results, or getting a +1 to the roll. In this game, there will be an alternate dice mechanic which is based around rolling a relatively large number of d6s, and checking how many of those dice go over a certain threshhold of success.</p>

          <p>In a normal roll, you will roll a number of dice equal to 1 plus your relevant stat, and count the number of dice that have a five or six. A moderately difficult challenge will require two of these successes.</p>

          <p>Having a relevant skill will allow you to roll an additional die, more difficult tasks may require additional success dice. The success threshhold for inidividual dice will generally only be affected by magic.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>In addition:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We can't spend clues to improve our rolls for making new practices, which is intended to make all the cards in our spellcasting groups other than the strongest one more important.</li>
          <li>The rules around how the cards from the Family table affect your life have been changed to a different, significantly more complicated system, but it still ends up determining the same sorts of things, it's just more likely to screw with your starting spells.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      </div>

    <section class="rulesChanges">
      <div class="inner">
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        
          <ul>
            <li>You should probably come up with multiple character concepts before the game, since your ideas might not fit with the cards you get or the concessions you have to make in order to get them.</li>
            <li>Come in with some idea of how you value each table relative to each other table. Whatever you pick first, you're more likely to get.</li>
            <li>As you get more bonuses to spellcrafting, the best cards you have in your spell stats (Puissance, Access, Longevity, Excecutions) become far more important than the worst ones.</li>
            <li>The School table doesn't just determine whether you get to be your ideal type of practitioner- it also determines what bonuses you get when crafting spells, and what kinds of random magical tidbits your character has also acquired before the game starts. In general, a good set of Schools cards means you're more likely to have spells which use your best Spellcasting cards rather than your worst ones.</li>
            <li>The cards are weighted towards bad results- Which is to say, a Worst card is gonna be more or less the worst realistic result in a given category, whereas a Supreme is going to be very good for you but not the best thing you can think of. This is more about avoiding remarkably bad results than getting remarkably good ones.</li>
            <li>There is no realistic way to improve your spellcasting cards after the draft. If your best Longevity card is a "Moderate," you will never get any spells with a Longevity better than "Moderate."</li>
          </ul>

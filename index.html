            <p>You will be selecting cards from pre-arranged tables in order to build a character with them.</p>

            <p>Some cards have better quality than others, and you will compete with other players to get the best ones.</p>
                
            <p>There are multiple categories, so it's possible for everyone to be the best at different things- or for one person to end up with all the best cards, and everyone else to end up with very weak characters.</p>

            <h1>The Draft, Step-by-Step</h1>

            <ol>
                <li> Cards are laid out to form the six tables; each table contains 3 Supremes (15%), 5 Goods (25%), 5 Poors (25%), 5 Awfuls (25%), and 2 (10%) Worsts, shuffled into random positions.</li>
                <li>All players simultaneously and secretly select a row or column that they want from one table of their choice.</li>
                <li>If everyone selected different rows/columns from each table, they each pick one card from their selection to keep. If there are cards that multiple players selected, those players Clash.</li>
                <li>All cards that got taken are replaced with face-down cards from the "Unknown" deck. The Unknown deck has a distribution of 1 Supreme (5%), 2 Goods (10%), 3 Moderates (15%), 4 Poors (20%), 5 Awfuls (25%), and 5 Worsts (25%).</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 until each player has five cards from each table.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Clashes</h1>

            <p>First, players get a chance to make a deal. In a deal you may propose any possible split of cards (for example P1 taking a supreme card, and P2 taking the remaining four).</p>
            
            <p>Players draw Unknown cards equal to the number they gave to their opponent, so they will always end up taking five no matter what.</p>
                
            <p>Deals may also include promises about what kind of character you'll play, or what relationships they'll have to other characters.</p>

            <p>If the players can't or won't agree to a deal, they go to a Dilemma, which resembles the prisoner's Dilemma, with players having the chance to get white marks (perks and advantages) or black marks (flaws and detrimental traits).</p>
